## üõ†Ô∏è The Tech Stack: React + Django - A Perfect Match

ProjectHub leverages the robust combination of **Django for the backend** and **React for the frontend**, perfectly aligning with the project's requirements for scalability, security, and a rich user experience.

### Django (Backend)
* **Secure & Scalable API:** Ideal for handling user accounts, managing database models for projects, comments, and user profiles.
* **Efficient Data Management:** Built-in ORM simplifies interaction with the database.
* **Rapid Admin Panel:** Django's powerful admin interface provides a huge time-saver for managing users and projects efficiently.

### React (Frontend)
* **Dynamic User Interface:** Perfect for building an interactive and responsive frontend.
* **Seamless User Experience:** Users can browse projects, filter by categories (e.g., department, technologies), and engage in real-time commenting.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Facilitates modular development and reusability.

## üåü Key Features (MVP)

Our Minimum Viable Product focuses on delivering core functionalities that provide immediate value:

* **User Authentication:** Secure student signup (potentially restricted to college email addresses) and login.
* **Project Submission:** An intuitive form for students to submit their projects, including:
    * Title and detailed description
    * Links to code repositories (e.g., GitHub)
    * Links to live demos (if available)
    * Ability to upload screenshots
* **Project Showcase:** A main page displaying all projects in an engaging gallery format (e.g., interactive cards).
* **Project Detail Page:** Dedicated pages for each project, presenting all submitted details comprehensively.
* **Commenting/Feedback:** A simple, integrated comment section on each project detail page for community feedback and discussion.

## üöÄ Our Approach to Building ProjectHub

We believe in a structured and efficient development process:

### 1. Backend First (Django)
We'll start by laying a solid foundation:
* **Database Models:** Define essential models for `User`, `Project`, `Tag` (for technologies like 'Python', 'React', 'AI'), and `Comment`.
* **API Endpoints:** Develop secure and efficient API endpoints for:
    * Retrieving all projects
    * Fetching a single project
    * Creating new projects
    * Adding and managing comments

### 2. Frontend (React)
Once the core API is stable, we'll shift our focus to the user-facing application:
* **Component Development:** Build reusable React components such as `ProjectCard`, `ProjectList`, `ProjectDetailPage`, and `LoginPage`.
* **API Integration:** Connect the React components to the Django API to fetch, display, and submit data, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience.
